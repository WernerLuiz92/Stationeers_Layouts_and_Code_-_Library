# Base Area Descriptions

## HAB (Habitat)
The main living and control area of the base, responsible for temperature regulation, atmospheric composition, and other essential life support systems.

## GSF (Gas Storage and Filtration)
This area is designated for the storage and filtration of various gases, ensuring the base has a clean and adequate supply of breathable air and other necessary gases.

## GMA (Gas Mixing Area)
A specialized area for mixing different gases to achieve the desired atmospheric composition or for other specific uses within the base.

## SEP (Solar Energy Production)
The section of the base dedicated to the generation of energy using solar panels. It harnesses sunlight to produce electricity for the base.

## WEP (Wind Energy Production)
This area is responsible for generating energy through wind turbines. It converts wind energy into electricity to power the base.

## BBA (Battery and Backup Area)
The section of the base dedicated to the storage of batteries and the production of backup energy, ensuring a stable and continuous power supply in case of primary energy source failure.

## WRF (Water Recycling and Filtration)
An area for the storage, recycling, and filtration of water. It ensures a continuous and clean supply of water for the base.

## MIN (Mining Area)
The designated zone for mining operations, where raw materials are extracted from the environment for further processing.

## OSA (Ore Storage Area)
The storage area for mined ores, keeping raw materials organized and ready for processing when needed.

## OPR (Ore Processing Area)
The area where raw ores are processed, typically involving furnaces or other machinery to extract usable materials from mined ore.

## MPA (Material Production Area)
This zone is equipped with printers and other fabrication devices to produce various materials and components needed for the base.

## MRA (Material Recycling Area)
An area focused on the recycling of materials, turning waste into reusable resources and managing the base's waste products.

## AGR (Agricultural Area)
The section of the base dedicated to growing plants and crops, providing food and possibly other resources like oxygen.

## FPA (Food Production Area)
The kitchen and food preparation area, where meals are made and food supplies are managed to sustain the base's crew.

## GRA (Genetic Research Area)
The section of the base dedicated to genetic research related to plant genetics.

## STG (Storage Area)
The general storage area for various supplies, tools, and equipment, ensuring that all necessary items are organized and easily accessible.

## TRA (Trading Area)
The area designated for commerce and trade, where goods and resources can be exchanged with other bases or entities.

## UTL (Utilities)
Codes and scripts for common utilities used in the Stationeers game.

## OLD (Old codes)
Old codes and scripts that are no longer in use or outdated.
